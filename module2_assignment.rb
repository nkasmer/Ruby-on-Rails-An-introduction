#Implement a class called LineAnalyzer.

  #Implement the following read-only attributes in the LineAnalyzer class.

  #* initialize() - taking a line of text (content) and a line number
  #* calculate_word_frequency() - calculates result

  #  highest_count_words_across_lines attribute values
  #* print_highest_word_frequency_across_lines() - prints the values of LineAnalyzer objects in 
  #  highest_count_words_across_lines in the specified format
